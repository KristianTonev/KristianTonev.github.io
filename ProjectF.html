<u><h2>Aims of Project</h2></u>
<br><p>
  The aim of my project is to identify whether leading Macroeconomic indicators can be used to predict Real GDP, and hence, recessionary periods in the USA.
  I also explore the relationship between the changes in these Macroeconomic indicators and the returns of the S&P 500 index. The three indicators that I explore 
  are Consumer Sentiment, the 10 Year – 2 Year Treasury Yield Curve, and Total Non-Farm Employment.
<br><br>
  The Consumer Sentiment Index is published every month by the University of Michigan and is calculated based on the responses of consumers to five questions 
  <a href="https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/survey-info.php">(further information).</a>
<br><br>
  The 10 Year – 2 Year Treasury Yield Curve is calculated by subtracting the 2-year treasury rate from the 10-year treasury rate. 
  Since long dated bonds typically have a higher yield, as these securities have higher duration and investors need to be compensated for inflation and interest rate risks,
  the yield curve is typically positive.
  <br><br>
  Non-Farm Employment is the measure of the number of workers in the USA, excluding farm workers and workers in a handful of other job classifications. It provides
  an insight into the US labour market.
  </p>
  <br><br><u><h2>Data</h2></u>
    <br>
    <p>
    The data relating to the Macroeconomic indicators and Real GDP is sourced from FRED. The S&P 500 data is sourced from the website Investing.com.
    <br><br>
    Three of my charts use APIs. These are the charts in which there are two y-axes. In order to access the data for these charts, I employed Python and <a href="https://github.com/KristianTonev/KristianTonev.github.io/blob/main/Project.ipynb"> Google Colab.</a>
    I first set a base URL which connected me to the data source (i.e. FRED) and following this created a loop which fetched the data for the series that I listed. The beginning of the URL is very important because it allows me to pull contents from any page via API and avoid same-origin policy problems. 
    <br><br>
    Upon running the code, I was left with four URLs that automatically update their respective data series, every time FRED updates their data. This saves a significant amount of time if I were to want to observe the future development of these data series because I do not have to manually update them every time new data points are released. 
    <br><br>
    The data for the remaining graphs I made comes in the format of csv files after I downloaded the data from either FRED or Investing.com.

  <u><h2>Data Cleaning</h2></u>
  <br><p>
    The analysis for my histogram was done in excel whereby I created bins for daily S&P 500 returns and subsequently used the “data analysis” Excel add-in to create the diagram.
    <br><br>
    For my bar chart, I found the first day the T10Y-T2Y yield curve turned negative on every occasion. I subsequently took the S&P 500 price on this date and took the price one
     year later to calculate the return. The return for 2022 is an average of the previous returns as we have not yet reached one year since the curve inverted earlier in the year.
    <br><br>
    For the Non-Farm Employment scatter graph, I had to clean the data and remove one outlier that was a result of Covid-19. Due to the nature of the pandemic, Total Non-Farm
     Employees dropped by 20.493 million in April 2020. To highlight the size of this outlier, the average month-on-month change is roughly 128,000. As this data point greatly
      skewed the graph, it was removed.
    <br><br>
    I also worked on the visualisation of the API graphs, which each layered three separate data series, so that I could convey the information effectively. This required a 
    significant number of transformations, calculations, and controls in Vega-Lite.
    
    </p>
    <br><br><u><h2>Conclusions</h2></u>
      <br>
      <p>
        Starting with consumer sentiment, one can observe that US recessions are typically preceded or coincide with a steep decline in sentiment. Once sentiment drops below 85,
         it is usually a good indicator of recession. Next, we have non-farm employment, which is more of a confirmation indicator that stalls as we are experiencing a recession.
         It follows a similar trend to Real GDP. Then, we have the T10Y-T2Y yield curve which has turned negative before every US recession in the last 40 years. 
         <br><br>
        On the contrary, turning to my scatter graphs, they show little relation between month-on-month S&P 500 returns and month-on-month changes of my macroeconomic indicators, 
        with R-squared values near zero.
        <br><br> 
        Overall, however, observing the trends in these macroeconomic indicators actually proves quite profitable and supports in predicting GDP and generating returns. For 
        example, my bar chart shows the historical returns achieved if you invested in the S&P 500 every time the yield curve first inverted. Over the last 40 years, the yield 
        curve has inverted 13 times and on average the S&P 500 has generated a return of 11.5% in the year following the inversion. This compares to an average annual return of 
        9.4% over the last 50 years.

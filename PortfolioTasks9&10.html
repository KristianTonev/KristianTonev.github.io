    <hr>

    <p>This task involved conducting two <a href="https://github.com/KristianTonev/KristianTonev.github.io/blob/main/MachineL.ipynb">machine learning analyses</a>
      (Classification and Dimensionality Reduction). The main hypothesis that I explore is how well the KNN and SVC models can classify different wines based only on two
      features.
    <br><br>
    I find that the KNN and SVC models are decent classifiers. Subsequently, I find that even with only two dimensions, the different wines are still seperated fairly well.

  <h2>Figure 1:</h2>
  Plot of 178 wines from 3 different winemakers based on each wine's colour intensity and hue (shaded areas reflects prediction of KNN model about which winemaker grew the
   wine)

  <h2>Figure 2:</h2>
  After using the PCA model to implement a Dimensionality Reduction, each axis represents one dimension (axes have no meaning)
  <div class= "grid_item"><img src="pca.jpg"></div>

  <h2>Figure 3:</h2>
  The original dataset had 13 features to describe each wine. The graph below shows that with only a couple features one can capture almost all of the variance
